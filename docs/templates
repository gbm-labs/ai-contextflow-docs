# UI Design System & Tokens

## Purpose
This document defines the **project-specific UI design system constraints** used by frontend development and AI-assisted implementation.

It acts as the **single source of truth** for visual consistency, accessibility-aligned design decisions, and UI predictability.

This document is **project-specific** and intentionally separate from global standards.

---

## How to Use This Template

- Copy this file into your project as:
  - `project/ui-design-system.md`
- Fill it out before significant frontend work starts.
- Reference it explicitly in AI prompts and during frontend implementation.

---

## 1. Design System Strategy

### Design System Approach
Select the primary approach:
- Existing design system / component library
- Custom lightweight design system
- Hybrid (existing base + custom extensions)

Describe briefly:
- Why this approach was chosen
- What level of strictness is expected

---

## 2. Design Tokens

Design tokens define the **non-negotiable visual primitives**.

### Color Tokens
- Primary color(s):
- Secondary / accent color(s):
- Neutral / background colors:
- Semantic colors (success, warning, error, info):

Accessibility notes (contrast expectations):

---

### Typography Tokens
- Font families:
- Base font size:
- Heading scale:
- Line height rules:

---

### Spacing & Layout Tokens
- Base spacing unit:
- Allowed spacing scale:
- Layout grid or container rules:

---

### Border & Shape Tokens
- Border radius rules:
- Border widths:
- Elevation / shadow usage (if any):

---

## 3. Component Rules

### Core Components
List components that must be reused instead of reimplemented:
- Buttons
- Inputs / forms
- Modals / dialogs
- Navigation elements

---

### Component Usage Rules
- When to create a new component vs reuse
- Composition rules
- Forbidden patterns (if any)

---

## 4. Interaction & Motion

- Animation / transition principles:
- Motion limits (duration, easing):
- Reduced-motion expectations:

---

## 5. Accessibility Baseline

This project commits to:
- Semantic markup
- Keyboard accessibility
- Visible focus indicators
- Clear error messaging

Additional accessibility notes:

---

## 6. Responsiveness & Breakpoints

- Target devices:
- Breakpoints (if defined):
- Responsive behavior rules:

---

## 7. Performance Constraints

- Maximum acceptable UI complexity:
- Known performance-sensitive areas:
- Rendering constraints (if applicable):

---

## 8. Non-Goals

Explicitly list what this design system does **not** try to solve.

---

## 9. Governance

- Owner of the design system:
- How changes are proposed and approved:
- Versioning strategy (if applicable):

---

## Status

- Author:
- Date:
- Status: Draft / Active / Deprecated
